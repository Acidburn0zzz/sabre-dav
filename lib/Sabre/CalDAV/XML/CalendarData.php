 * CalendarData parser.

 * This class parses the {urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:caldav}calendar-data XML
 * element, as defined in:
 *
 * https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4791#section-9.6
 *
 * This element is used for three distinct purposes:
 *
 * 1. To return calendar-data in a response, in which case this deserializer
 *    will just spit out a string.
 * 2. Information on how calendar-data should be returned, from a
 *    calendar-multiget or calendar-query REPORT, in which case this
 *    deserializer will spit out and array with the relevant information.
 * 3. A list of supported media-types, nested in the supported-calendar-data
 *    property. This case is currently not handled.
